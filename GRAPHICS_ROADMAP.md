# Graphics Improvement Roadmap

## Current State: Functional Blocks ✅
- Blue cube kart with black cylinder wheels
- Gray cube Business Cat placeholder  
- Green flat ground plane
- Basic lighting and shadows working

## Phase 1: Better Kart Design 🏎️

### Immediate Improvements (Next Session):
1. **Rounded Kart Body**
   - Replace cube with rounded box geometry
   - Add kart-like proportions (wider, lower profile)
   - Better materials with metallic/plastic shaders

2. **Proper Wheels**  
   - Tire-like cylinders with tread texture
   - Rims/hubcaps with metallic material
   - Proper wheel suspension animation

3. **Business Cat Character**
   - Replace cube with basic cat shape (spheres + cylinders)
   - Black fur with red tie (simple materials)
   - Sitting position in kart

## Phase 2: Environment Polish 🌍

### Track Improvements:
1. **Textured Ground**
   - Asphalt/concrete texture instead of flat green
   - Track markings and boundaries
   - Grass areas around track

2. **Better Lighting**
   - More realistic sun positioning
   - Enhanced shadows and ambient lighting
   - Sky gradient instead of flat color

3. **Environmental Objects**
   - Simple barriers around track edges
   - Basic trees/buildings in distance
   - Corporate-themed decorations

## Phase 3: Track Design 🏁

### First Real Track:
1. **Oval Circuit**
   - Banked turns with proper geometry
   - Start/finish line with checkered pattern
   - Lap counting markers

2. **Track Boundaries**
   - Invisible collision walls
   - Visual barriers (walls, grass, etc.)
   - Track surface with racing line

## Phase 4: Visual Effects ✨

### Enhanced Visual Feedback:
1. **Particle Effects**
   - Dust clouds from wheels
   - Drift smoke effects
   - Speed boost trails

2. **Animation**
   - Wheel rotation based on speed
   - Character bobbing/leaning in turns
   - Suspension compression

3. **UI Elements**
   - Speed indicator
   - Lap counter
   - Position display

## Implementation Priority

### Next Development Session:
**Focus: Make it look like an actual kart instead of blocks**

1. ✅ Controls working (DONE)
2. 🎯 **Improve kart 3D model** (rounded body, better wheels)
3. 🎯 **Add basic Business Cat** (simple cat shape)
4. 🎯 **Better ground texture** (asphalt instead of green)

### Week 2:
**Focus: Create first real racing track**

1. Build oval track with boundaries
2. Add track textures and markings
3. Implement lap counting system

### Week 3:
**Focus: Visual polish and effects**

1. Particle effects for wheels/drift
2. Better lighting and shadows
3. Environmental decorations

## Technical Notes

### Current Rendering Capabilities:
- ✅ Three.js with shadow mapping
- ✅ Multiple materials and textures
- ✅ Particle systems available
- ✅ Custom shaders possible

### Asset Strategy:
- **Procedural geometry** for basic shapes (fast iteration)
- **Simple textures** for surface details
- **DALL-E concepts** for inspiration/reference
- **Manual modeling** for final polish

### Performance Targets:
- Maintain 60fps with enhanced graphics
- Efficient LOD system for distant objects
- Optimized texture usage

---

**The goal:** Transform from "functional blocks" to "recognizable Business Cat kart racing game" while maintaining the solid mechanics we've built.
