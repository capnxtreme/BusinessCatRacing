# Business Cat Racing - Next Steps

## Current Status (After Major Milestone)

### ‚úÖ **Completed Systems:**
1. **Core Engine Foundation** - Three.js + Cannon.js working
2. **Input System** - Complete with 28 tests (agent-generated)
3. **Camera System** - Advanced following cameras (agent-generated)  
4. **Basic Kart** - 3D model with physics integration
5. **Game Loop** - 60fps with physics synchronization

### üêõ **Current Issue: Controls Not Working**
**Problem:** Kart visible but WASD controls don't move it
**Debugging Added:** Console logging for input detection and force application

**Likely Causes:**
1. InputManager not properly activated (FIXED: added setContext + setEnabled)
2. Physics forces too weak or not applied correctly
3. Kart physics body configuration issues
4. Event listeners not attached to window

### üîß **Immediate Fixes Needed:**

#### **1. Debug Controls (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Test with debug logging to see if inputs detected
- [ ] Check browser console for "Input:" and "Applying force:" logs
- [ ] Verify physics forces are reasonable magnitude
- [ ] Ensure InputManager event listeners work

#### **2. Physics Tuning**
- [ ] Increase engine force values (currently 750, try 5000+)
- [ ] Check physics body mass vs force ratio
- [ ] Verify ground collision is working
- [ ] Test with simpler box physics first

#### **3. Input System Verification**
- [ ] Test individual key events in browser console
- [ ] Verify InputManager.getInputState() returns correct values
- [ ] Check if focus/window events interfere

### üöÄ **Next Development Priorities:**

#### **Phase 1: Get Controls Working (THIS WEEK)**
1. **Fix Input ‚Üí Physics Pipeline**
   - Resolve current control issues
   - Test acceleration, steering, braking
   - Ensure responsive movement

2. **Camera Integration**
   - Connect existing CameraManager to follow kart
   - Implement chase camera as default
   - Test camera smoothness

#### **Phase 2: Character Integration (NEXT)**
3. **Business Cat Character**
   - Integrate agent-generated character system
   - Replace placeholder with actual Business Cat model
   - Add character-specific physics stats

4. **Track Creation**
   - Build first test track (simple oval)
   - Add track boundaries and collision
   - Implement lap counting system

#### **Phase 3: Gameplay Features**
5. **Race Mechanics**
   - Start/finish line detection
   - Lap timing and position tracking
   - Basic UI for speed/lap display

6. **Power-Up System** 
   - Implement business-themed items
   - Add item boxes and collection
   - Test item effects on kart

### üõ† **Development Commands:**

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Test controls in browser console
# Press F12, Console tab, try WASD keys
# Look for "Input:" and "Applying force:" logs

# Run tests
npm test

# Build production
npm run build
```

### üéØ **Success Criteria:**

**Immediate (Next Session):**
- [ ] WASD keys move the kart around the scene
- [ ] Physics feel responsive and realistic
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

**Short Term (1-2 Sessions):**  
- [ ] Camera follows kart smoothly
- [ ] Business Cat visible as driver
- [ ] Simple oval track with boundaries

**Medium Term (3-5 Sessions):**
- [ ] Complete race experience with lap counting
- [ ] Multiple characters unlocked and playable
- [ ] Basic power-up system working

### üìä **Architecture Status:**

**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage (62/62 passing)
- Modern TypeScript with strict typing
- Agent-generated systems are high quality

**Needs Work:**
- Input ‚Üí Physics integration
- 3D model quality (currently basic cubes)
- Track/environment implementation
- Audio system integration

### üö® **Blockers to Resolve:**

1. **Controls not responding** (blocking all gameplay)
2. Physics tuning needed for realistic feel
3. Camera system needs integration with existing renderer

---

**Next Dev Session Focus:** Get the kart moving with WASD controls, then integrate camera following.
