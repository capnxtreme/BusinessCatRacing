### Unit Tests
- `/tests/unit/character.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests for Character class (34 tests)
- `/tests/unit/characterManager.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests for CharacterManager class (31 tests)

## Key Features Implemented

### Character System
- **Individual Character States**: Health, unlock status, race statistics
- **Special Abilities**: Cooldown management, duration tracking, effect application
- **Stat Management**: Base stats with modifier support (1-10 scale)
- **Customization**: Kart colors, wheels, accessories, decals
- **Progression Tracking**: Win/loss records, best times, coins collected

### Character Manager
- **Unlock Progression**: Condition parsing and validation
- **Character Selection**: Safe switching between unlocked characters
- **Progress Tracking**: Global wins, races, cups completed, difficulties
- **Achievement System**: Extensible achievement tracking
- **Leaderboard**: Win rate and performance ranking
- **Serialization**: Complete save/load system for persistence

### Special Ability System
- **Cooldown Management**: Per-character ability timing
- **Effect Types**: Speed boost, shield, coin multiplier, item amplify, immunity, confusion, copy, teleport
- **Duration Tracking**: Automatic ability state updates
- **Copy Mechanics**: Intern Hamster can copy other character abilities
- **Balance Considerations**: Varied cooldowns and durations for competitive play

### Unlock System
- **Condition Parsing**: Natural language unlock conditions
- **Multiple Unlock Types**: Race wins, cup completions, difficulty achievements
- **Progressive Unlock**: Tiered character availability
- **Flexible Conditions**: Supports complex multi-requirement unlocks

## Character Balance

### Stat Distribution
- **All characters have 28 total stat points** for balance
- **Weight Classes**: Light (1-3), Medium (4-7), Heavy (8-10)
- **Playstyle Variety**: Speed demons, handling experts, balanced racers
- **No Dominant Strategy**: Each character viable in different situations

### Ability Balance
- **Varied Cooldowns**: 40-90 seconds to prevent spam
- **Different Durations**: 3-20 seconds for tactical timing
- **Unique Effects**: No duplicate abilities among starting characters
- **Strategic Depth**: Abilities require timing and positioning

## Code Quality

### Testing Coverage
- **59 total tests** covering all major functionality
- **Character Class**: 34 tests for abilities, stats, progression, serialization
- **CharacterManager Class**: 31 tests for unlocks, selection, persistence
- **Mocked Dependencies**: Clean isolation for unit testing
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Architecture
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interfaces and enums
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns between Character and CharacterManager
- **Data-Driven**: Configuration separated from logic
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new characters or abilities
- **Performance**: Efficient unlock checking and ability management

### Code Organization
- **Clean Separation**: Types, entities, data, and tests in logical folders
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uniform coding style and structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline comments and type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and validation

## Integration Points

### Physics System Integration
- **Stat Application**: Character stats can modify physics parameters
- **Ability Effects**: Special abilities can influence movement and collision
- **Independent Design**: Works without physics system for testing

### Game Loop Integration
- **Update Cycle**: Ability state management in game tick
- **Event System**: Character selection and unlock notifications
- **Persistence**: Save/load integration with game state

### UI Integration Ready
- **Character Selection**: Complete character switching API
- **Progress Display**: Win rates, unlock progress, statistics
- **Customization**: Kart modification system foundation
- **Leaderboard**: Performance ranking and comparison

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Connect to Physics**: Apply character stats to kart physics parameters
2. **UI Implementation**: Character selection screen and progression display
3. **Race Integration**: Ability activation during races
4. **Save System**: Connect serialization to game persistence
5. **Audio/Visual**: Hook ability effects to game presentation layer

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Initialize character system
const characterManager = new CharacterManager();

// Select a character
characterManager.selectCharacter(CharacterType.BUSINESS_CAT);

// Use special ability during race
const currentTime = Date.now();
if (characterManager.activateCharacterAbility(CharacterType.BUSINESS_CAT, currentTime)) {
  // Apply speed boost effect
}

// Update progression after race
characterManager.updateProgress(1, 1); // 1 win, 1 race
characterManager.updateCharacterStats(CharacterType.BUSINESS_CAT, true, 120000, 50);

// Check unlocks
characterManager.checkUnlockConditions();

// Save character data
const saveData = characterManager.serialize();
```

The character system is now complete and ready for integration with the racing game mechanics!
